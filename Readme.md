# DataVault - Protecting Your Data on the Blockchain

DataVault is a decentralized application (Dapp) that allows users to securely store their passwords and files on the blockchain. The application employs advanced encryption techniques to ensure the confidentiality of user data, and the encrypted information is stored on the blockchain, accessible only by the user with the private key.
